# AI Context Setup for Code Assistant

This Angular 20+ project uses:

- Standalone components and services
- No suffixes like `.component.ts` or `.service.ts`
- Angular signals for state (`signal`, `computed`, `effect`)
- Modern template control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@defer`)
- TailwindCSS for styling

Gemini should infer component types by usage patterns, imports, and folder structure.
